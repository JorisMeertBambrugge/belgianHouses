This project is a data science and data visualization demo with python (bokeh), by Joris Meert.
The history 1973-2017 of Belgian house/villa/appartment/building ground is shared by setting up an interactive website.

To serve the website from your PC: 
1. download the files
2. Open a cmd in the folder where you saved the files
3. run the command: "bokeh serve --port 5010 --show --allow-websocket-origin=*"

Prior to this, you should have installed Python v3+, and the python module called Bokeh. Make sure the bokeh.exe and pyton.exe file directories are added to your PATH variables.

Raw data is coming from the Belgian Governement (https://statbel.fgov.be/en).
